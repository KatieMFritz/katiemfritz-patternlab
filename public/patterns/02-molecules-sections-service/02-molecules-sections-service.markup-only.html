  <section class="m-service__desc">
    <p>Are you generally happy with your website, but want to keep it fresh? I can coach your team through a website review process to clean up old content, catch features that aren’t working, improve search engine optimization, and generally revive your
      site.</p>
    <p>This is a great habit to do yearly – or more! After the first time, you’ll be equipped to manage future reviews on your own.</p>
